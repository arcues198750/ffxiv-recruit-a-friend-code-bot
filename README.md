# ffxiv-recruit-a-friend-code-bot

Code for a bot to retrieve referral code for recruit a friend

Project started on the 30th of Jan around 12am. With the assitance of ol' mate tehmwak, we managed to get the code so that using Selenium, we have it logging us into the Final Fantasy website (curse Square Enix and their obnoxiously long URL's). So far we've struggled to get it to click on the one button we need it to as it's a flex object and uses a javascript callback rather than a direct URL redirection.

Update @ 5:22pm 30/01/22
Thanks to tehmwak. We managed to get the code to read javascript and click on the button which is required to get to the page that is needed.
